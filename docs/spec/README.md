## Source of Truth

### Milestones

**`docs/spec/milestones.docx`** and **`docs/spec/milestones.md`** are the **only** sources of truth for milestones and user stories.

- If any other milestones or spec copies exist elsewhere in the repository, they are **outdated** and **must not be used**.
- Always reference these files when planning or implementing features.

### Terminology

The correct terminology for Curio is:

| Term | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **organisation** | Top-level container entity (not "community") |
| **group** | Introduction series within an organisation (not "programme") |
| **user** | End-user / member receiving introductions (not "participant") |
| **organisation_admin** | Admin role for an organisation (not "community_admin") |
| **super_admin** | Platform-wide administration |

See `docs/spec/source-of-truth.md` for the complete terminology mapping and schema details.
